# covid-interactive-dashboard
The analysis of the covid data of Australia is demonstrated in 7 worksheets of Tableau. I show all these analysis in one dashboard to make it possible for users to reach all the charts and the map easily. User will be able to choose the date to reach the desired information or see trend of data in motion
